    <h1>About Seirios</h1>
    <p>
      In Australia, each state has their very own convoluted government website with information about local regulations and requirements for travellers divided up and strewn across multiple pages.
      <br/>
      This makes it incredibly confusing for those wishing to engage in regional and interstate travel. The most tenacious and tech savvy person will be able to piece together all the rules, but everyone else is left in the dark. This has also resulted in Australia’s multilingual communities missing out on vital coronavirus information as the complicated content is not translated.
    </p>
    <p>We are presented with a unique design opportunity, to make a web application which will address the above problems, as well as encourage local travel in a ‘COVID normal’ society. Our web application is called Seirios, named after the brightest star in our galaxy, shining light in the darkness. We thought the guiding star would be a good analogy, as stars were often used by travellers to navigate the lands.</p>
